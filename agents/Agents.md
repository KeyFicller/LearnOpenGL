# Agent Communication Rules

1. Be concise; simply report current status and results
2. Check for existing reusable logic before writing code
3. Do not modify code when the question ends with "?"
4. Ensure compilation passes after modifying files
5. To avoid auto-formatting issues, include GLAD after GLFW, with a blank line between them
